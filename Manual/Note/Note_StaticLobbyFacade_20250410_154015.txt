If you're making an integer-based game,  
the only things that matter are:  

- What the lobby receives:  
  `StaticIntMono_ListenIntegerReceivedFromServer`  
- What the player wants to send to the lobby:  
  `StaticIntMono_PushUnityToServer`  

All other complexity is hidden behind the static link.

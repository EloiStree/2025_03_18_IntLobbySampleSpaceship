You send an integer and receive one in return.

Now, letâ€™s broadcast that to the child objects.

This avoids creating static or tightly coupled links everywhere.

To listen for integers that a child wants to send to the lobby, use:  
- `IntActionMono_ListenToIntegerEmitter`

To notify all children that an integer was received, use:  
- `IntActionMono_BroadcastDiffuser`

If you want to abstract away the lobby logic, you can pair it with these static classes:  
- `StaticIntMono_ListenIntegerReceivedFromServer`  
- `StaticIntMono_PushUnityToServer`
